# Learn blockchain and DLT
This is my first step to using Git seriously. Although I know it long time ago ,but I've never used this. 
This time I learned python for a while, and I know blockchain quite well now.
So I want to learn to combine them together and be familiar with writing code.
I realise that study by myself maybe a little bit hard. but I WILL try to persist becasue it is interesting for me as if I am learning a new language.
